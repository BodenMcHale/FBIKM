# FBIKM - Full-Body Inverse Kinematics Manager

## Hi, Kids! Ya like robots?
What is this? This is a Godot plugin made to be an imitation of Dr. Andreas Aristidou's Forward And Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics [demonstration]
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN6RQ4yrNPU). It is a simple little tool that explores the wonders of the FABRIK algorithm.

## Why, should You care?
You should care because this entire project was a mistake; a massive, 6 month spanning mistake. I entered this knowing nothing. I had but a singular goal in mind: to make procedual animations for a game. But all these months passed, and the game is nowhere closer to being complete. 
**But all is not lost!**
My time has not been wasted per se; its just that I ended up with things that are not particular use to me. **But they could be useful to you!** All the pitfalls I stepped on are now the pitfalls you __CAN__ learn to avoid. 

## Usage 
As you may have guessed this will be closer a blog than to your standard Godot plugin. If you are only interested in how to use this plugin, check the wiki for the documentation. If you're not, then buckle up kiddos, there is a long road ahead of us.

## What can I offer?
If what your current project touches upon the themes of:
- Procedual Animations
- Vectors, Transforms(Matrices), or Quaternions
- The FABRIK algorithm
- Godot shenanigans ~~and GDNative~~
	- But for real, I have seen nobody explain how to use `_set`, `_get`, and `_get_property_list` functions properly anywhere on the net, ~~much less something like a concise guide to what you can do in GDNative~~.

...then I may have commited some mistakes you can learn from. If nothing, on this list catches your eye, you are free to close this tab right now, but atleast take with you a piece of wisdom as a parting gift. **_Practice patience. If the job ahead of you looks hard, make sure you actually have to do it. _**

## Where did it all go down hill?
